          My Journey
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
          I'm <strong>Lwidiko Edward Mhamilawa</strong>, a passionate educator, scientist, and social entrepreneur from Tanzania. Over the past decade, I’ve dedicated my life to transforming how children and communities engage with science and technology.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
          As the founder of <strong>Project Inspire</strong>, I’ve worked to bridge the gap between imagination and innovation. What began as a small effort has grown into a movement — creating Tanzania’s first Science Center in Tanga, engaging thousands of children weekly, and inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-8 mb-6">
          My mission is bold: to democratize STEM education for <strong>one million Tanzanian children</strong> by 2034. With over 100 STEM Hubs, public-private partnerships, and a clear vision, I believe every child should have the opportunity to discover their potential.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-8">
          Beyond STEM, I’m a believer in people, in perseverance, and in the power of hope. My story is still unfolding — and this is only the beginning.
